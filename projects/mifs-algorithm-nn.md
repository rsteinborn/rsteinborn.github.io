# The MIFS Algorithm using Neural Networks

## Description

This project implements the Mutual Information based Feature Selection (MIFS) algorithm as described by Battiti (1994), demonstrated with a neural network using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.

## Key Features

- Implementation of the MIFS algorithm
- Integration with neural network architecture
- Comparative analysis of feature selection efficiency
